# Programming notebook 

This repository contains my reference materia and notes on various programming paradigms and practices, including Test Driven Development (TDD), Functional Programming (FP), and Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

I am mostly referencing YouTube videos that I found helpful in understanding these concepts. However, I also include some articles and papers that provide additional insights.
Feel free to explore the different sections to learn more about each topic!
